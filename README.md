# Evolutionary-timetable-scheduling - Solving timetable scheduling problem using genetic algorithms
The scheduling problems are essentially theproblems that deal with effective distribution ofresources.
During the scheduling process many constraints have to be considered. 
Resources areusually limited and no two tasks should occupy one particular resource at the same time.
For most of the scheduling problems it has beenshown that they are NP-hard, and that they can
not be solved in polynomial time using a deterministic algorithm. 
This algorithm was tested on small and large instances of the problem. 
Algorithm performance was significantly enhanced with modification of basic genetic operators.

# Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems
based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution. The algorithm repeatedly modifies
a population of individual solution. The best point in the population approaches an optimal solution. A
population is maintained and the fittest timetables are selected to form the basis of the next generation
or iteration. In GA there are three basic operator which are selection, crossover and mutation. This three
operator is applied to get the best results. The initialization of a population, the evaluation, and the
genetic operator were implemented and controlled by using programming. The GA will assign course
in what class, at what time and the instructor involved. Initial population is generated randomly.
